# OS variants table.  This is a variance of the data from 
# ls /usr/lib/python2.X/site-packages/virtinst/FullVirtGuest.py
# but replicated here as we can't assume cobbler is installed on a system with libvirt.
# in many cases it will not be (i.e. old EL4 server, etc) and we need this info to
# know how to validate --os-variant and --os-version. 
#
# The keys of this hash correspond with the --breed flag in Cobbler.
# --breed has physical provisioning semantics as well as virt semantics.
#
# presense of something in this table does /not/ mean it's supported.
# for instance, currently, "redhat", "debian", and "suse" do something interesting.
# the rest are undefined (for now), this will evolve.
