Things to do on the Web User Interface

- make fields wider that need to be wider (most can probably be ~128?  Ksmeta/Kopts min 255)
- modify form fields that should be radio boxes, etc (things like arch, breed)
- kickstart file editing and new kickstart file creation (if in /var/lib/cobbler/kickstarts)
- ???
- quick docs for Wiki
- testing
